Hello! My name is Jamie Moffatt. Thank you for visiting my website.

I'm a researcher in psychology. My research concerns the cognitive and neural underpinnings of voice-hearing experiences.

I am currently employed as a research assistant at Durham University, as part of the Hearing the Voice project. However, I will soon be starting my PhD research at the University of Sussex.

In my spare time I'm a keen gamer, reader and coder.
